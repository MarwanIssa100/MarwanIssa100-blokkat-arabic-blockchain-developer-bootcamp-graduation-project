## Design Patterns
1 - Importing and extending contracts:
    Ownable module from openzeppline 

2 - Restricting access to certain functions using Ownable 

3 - Creating more efficient Solidity code

## Security best practices

1 - Using Specific Compiler Pragma

2 - Proper Use of Require

3 - Use Modifiers Only for Validation 

4 - Checks-Effects-Interactions
